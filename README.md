# LTODASHBOARD

A lightweight, deployable static site scaffolded for a Modern Minimalist / Clean SaaS dashboard. The initial tab focuses on a **Bulk Asset Exchange** workflow with airy cards, gradients, and pill accents.

## Running locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. If you prefer a local server, run for example:

```sh
python -m http.server 5173
```

Then visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Structure
- `index.html` — markup for the dashboard shell and the Bulk Asset Exchange tab.
- `styles.css` — theme-styled layout with gradients, soft shadows, and responsive grid.
- `app.js` — minimal tab-handling logic ready for future tabs.
